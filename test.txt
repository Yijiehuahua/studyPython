The enlightening picture portrays that a hot pot, with numerous ingredients in it, includes such domestic and alien cultures as literature, moral values and performing arts. 
It seems that the hot pot tastes very delicious because of the rich nutrition of the multi-cultural elements.
Obviously, the picture characterizes the status quo of Chinese society in which Chinese and Western culture conflict with each other but also merge into a unique form to a certain degree. 
Since China has opened its door widely to the outside world, many people from different countries have been deeply fascinated by Chinese culture. 
They will accept and love the Chinese culture as a whole. 
In addition, Chinese culture should be well shared with foreign people, who have shown their enthusiasm towards China. 
Meanwhile, the Chinese people are also exposed to foreign cultures when more foreign people come to this oriental country. 
In this way people from various nations in the world will be able to acquire better understanding of each other and live peacefully in this world.
So,it tastes good.
